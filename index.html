        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Bhanu Chandan, a Data Specialist, Business Analyst, and Engineer with a passion for unraveling data insights and driving strategic business solutions. With over 4.5 years of experience as a System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, where I specialized in database management and customer support, I bring a unique blend of technical and business acumen to the table.</p>
        <p>After earning my Master's degree in Software Engineering and Management from Heilbronn University of Applied Sciences, I embarked on an exciting journey as a Data Specialist at ANEST IWATA EUROPE GmbH. Starting as a working student, then intern, and now a full-time data professional, I thrive in environments that challenge me to turn complex data into actionable insights.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I delve into web development, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Explore my projects, accomplishments, and the skills I've honed along the way. Let's connect and create something impactful together!</p>
