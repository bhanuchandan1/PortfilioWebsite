            <h3>5. Daily IT Tasks and SQL Queries</h3>
            <p>In my daily IT tasks, I regularly create SQL queries to extract information from SAP Business One. I transform the tables when needed using Python to provide clear and accurate data for business analysis. Key tasks include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed SQL queries to extract and transform data from SAP Business One.</li>
                <li>Maintained and improved daily IT tasks related to database management.</li>
                <li>Used Python for data transformation to ensure data accuracy and relevance.</li>

            <h3>6. Data Engineer project </h3>
            <p>I've built a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using AWS services to process data from the Spotify API. This project leverages several AWS technologies to extract data, transform it into a structured format, and make it ready for analysis. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:</p>
            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extract:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spotify API: Source of raw data.</li>
                    <li>AWS Lambda (Data Extraction): Extracts data from the Spotify API every minute, triggered by Amazon CloudWatch.</li>
                    <li>Amazon S3 (Raw Data): Stores the extracted raw data.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Transform:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>AWS Lambda (Data Transformation): Processes and transforms the raw data, saving it into a structured format in S3.</li>
                    <li>Amazon S3 (Transformed Data): Stores the transformed data ready for analysis.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Load:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>AWS Glue Crawler: Infers the schema of the transformed data and updates the AWS Glue Data Catalog.</li>
                    <li>AWS Glue Data Catalog: Stores the schema and metadata.</li>
                    <li>Amazon Athena: Allows SQL querying and analysis of the transformed data.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>AWS Lambda for serverless compute</li>
                <li>Amazon S3 for data storage</li>
                <li>Amazon CloudWatch for triggering and monitoring</li>
                <li>AWS Glue for data cataloging and schema inference</li>
                <li>Amazon Athena for data analysis</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Key Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated data extraction from Spotify API</li>
                <li>Real-time data transformation and storage in S3</li>
                <li>Schema inference and cataloging with AWS Glue</li>
                <li>SQL-based data analysis using Amazon Athena</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Extraction: A CloudWatch rule triggers the data extraction Lambda function, which fetches data from the Spotify API and stores it in S3.</li>
                <li>Data Transformation: An S3 event triggers the data transformation Lambda function, which processes the raw data, saves the transformed data, and moves the processed files to avoid reprocessing.</li>
                <li>Data Loading: An AWS Glue Crawler updates the Data Catalog with the schema of the transformed data, making it available for querying in Athena.</li>
            </ul>
